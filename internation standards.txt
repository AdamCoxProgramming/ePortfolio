Hi Man,

"I think the countries or cities outside EU should promote some regulations which is similar to the GDPR"

As well as the regulations imposed by nation states there are international standards that companys from other parts of the world can benifit from following.
The ISO (International Organization for Standardization) develop standards which are recognized and applied globaly.
ISO 27001 is a standard for IT management of employee details and third party data among other things (International Organization for Standardization, 2020). 
Adoption of this standard can actually be used to help demonstrate compiance with GDPR.

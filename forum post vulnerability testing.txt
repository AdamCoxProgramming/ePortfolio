Hi Antonios,

This is a very imformative post with a good overview of how a data breach should be hanled in action.

I think that your sugestion of having this event kick of a review of IT processes is very correct.

I think they should specifically look at their “process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and 
organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing”(European Parliament, 2020: Artical 32)

When looking at their cyber security analysis procedure another component(along side penetration testing) they should look at is their vulnerablity assesment procedure.

The aim of a vulnerablity assesment is to use a range of tools and methodolagies to identify vulnerablitys and threats(Rouse, 2020).

Vulnerability assements aim to uncover as many vulnerablitys as possible whereas a penetration test aims to find how such vulnerabilitys could be exploited (Murashka, 2017).

A combination of vulnerablity assesment and penetration testing should feed into their improved cyber security analysis procedure.

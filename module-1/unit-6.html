											<h3>Unit 6: Operating Systems</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Operating Systems</p>

											<p>Operating systems allways provide at least functionality to:</p>
											
											<ul>
												<li>Store and access files</li>
												<li>Interface with applications</li>
											</ul>
											Famous examples of OS's are Windows and Linux.
											
											<h4>Early Operating Systems</h4>
											
											<p>The purpose of early operating systems was to allow easy set up and execution of programs. Humans manually operated the first machines and
											were them selves the first operating systems (known as operators). 
											These operators would be specialized in the specifics of preping the machnines for the execution of programs. These operators would take
											program requests from others and handle the machine specifics, as such they allowed programed and exection independance and acted as a 
											layer of abstraction.
										</p>

											<h4>Batch proccesing systems</h4>
											
											<p>Early systems made use of batch job ques. Batch processing systems store mutliple jobs and execute them sequentially without any input from 
											the user. These systems use a simple fi-fo (Que) data structure. The human operator would often act as the que, keeping track of program request
											order.
										</p>
											<h4>Interactive proccessing systems</h4>
											
											<p>Batch proccessing systems do not allow user input after adding a program. Interactive processing systems allow the user to inteact ith programs
											and the operating systems while programs are exectuing. Applications like word or web browsers are real time because the processes meet
											external deadlines, fore example imediatly showing the key pressed in a word doc.
										</p>
											<h4>Time Sharing</h4>
											
											<p>In the days of early commercial computers, it was common for one machine to serve multiple usersat once.
											This was enabled by  time sharing. Machines facilitating time haring take it in turns to opperate on each progrom. Each program will 
											be given a set interval off time for the programm to exectute. This implementtaion is called multiple programming. Switching between programs
											rapudly gives the illusion of simultanious programming.
										</p>
											Where multi-processing refers to one pc serving multiple users, multing tasking refers to one user being served multiple tasks.
											
											Modern operating systems coordinate process using load blancing and scaling to manage multi-tasking.
											
											Load balancing allocates tasks to multiple processors so that all are being utlized.
											Scalling involves breaking tasks in to small chunks that can be parrelized.
											
											Operating systems are seperate to the applications that they can run. 
											OS's provide a programmable interface that devleopers can use to control OS reatures such as storage and periphrial access.
											
											Operating systems often come packaged with utility programs.

											<h3>Academic writing</h3>
										</header>
										<p>During the launch module I developed my skills in academic writing.
Among other skills I learnt how use harvard referrencing and how to use tools such as Turnitin to avoid accidental plagarism.
For the induction assignment I wrote an essay on "The importance of a PG Cert in computer sceince".

Writing this essay I followed the steps:

<ul>
	<li>Read question and mark scheme
	<li>Search Google schoolars for releavnt papers
	<li>Read the relevant papers and collect many references and Ideas that could be talked about
	<li>Write the introduction and other key points specified in the breif
	<li>Trim back the collected ideas and references to form the core arguments 
	<li>Adjust the document to meet the Unit 1 & 2 guidence
	<li>Ittereate over the document tweaking order to make sure their is a contunious flow for the reader
	<li>Ask relative to proof read
	<li>Make grammer adjustemnts for highlighted regions
	<li>Run the document through a grammerly check
	<li>Finalize document
  </ul>

I think that the reading a broad collection of sources upfront is a good way to prepare the mind for idea synthisis.

Next time I would create a list of goals for the assignment for my self. 
Many of the resources provided in Unit 1 and Unit 2 provided guidence for writing the essay.
Next time I would aim to capture this guidence in a list of 'goals' to refer to during the writing process. 
This would eliminate the need to make adjustements to match the guidence after the essay had been written.</p>

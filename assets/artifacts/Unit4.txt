Web Browsers

This week expanded our knowledge of computer networks. 
The primary access point for most users to the internet is the web browser.
The web browser is a part of the application layer in the OSI and TCP/IP stacks.

Web browsers allow users to specify a page's adress, then loads the page and displays its contents.
Web sites a created using HMTL for layout items, css for layout stying and javscript for programmable client side functionality.

The web browser is a client, the web browser can display sites hosted on servers.

A browser will have at a bare minimum:
	
Networking functionality
Rendering engine
Javascript interpreter
Data persistance

The Rendering engine will format and display the mark up that the Networking retrives, the render engine will utilize the operating systems 
graphic drawing API's.
The data persistance will store users preferences and cookies that can be used for severs to store data on the client side.

Side note - diffferent browsers use differnt rendering engines. Unfourtuantly they implement CSS slightly differently meaning that
the same markup and styling can look different in different browsers. some render engine use their own specifc css.

I think digital signitures are a great way to help recipiants distinguish between sources of data.

They cannot ensure that data will not be leaked however. 

GDPR does not specifically address the use of passwords but it says that data should be 
"Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or 
unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures."

This requires businesses to prevent unauthorized access to personal data (ICO, 2020).

For high risk data such as passwords we dicided that storing the data on paper was the most secure method.

Storing passwords for root account access physicaly means that there is no means to obtain them by hacking.

Storing the data physically also restricts access to the data making it harder for the data to be leaked.

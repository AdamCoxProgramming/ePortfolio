											<h3>GDPR Best Practices Group Discussion</h3>
										</header>
										<p>On this page I shall recap the online group discussion we had about GDPR best practices.</p>
										
										<p>In my initial post, I discussed the ongoing legal battle between Facebook and the EU over Facebook's transfer of data to the US where they are employing lower Data Protection standards. 
											The agreement Facebook has been using for this allows American companies to process EU data. The agreement is called the Privacy Shield and this agreement means that although you may be using a service provided by an EU company that applies by GDPR if the data was hosted and processed in America it would not be held to the same standards.   
										</p>
										<p>
											Our tutor Nawaz Khan commented that this issue raised the old debate of 'law enforcement' vs 'ethical perspective' and suggested that organizations should also follow Corporate and Social Responsibility frameworks.  
										</p>
										<p>
											I researched the application of CSR and was interested to find that such frameworks have been made legal in China.  									
											I found that the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provide a framework that organizations can opt to use that provides guidance on CSR. 										
											I came across a case example of an organization that followed good ethical practice by being transparent about a breach they had had and considered how this had benefited the company's reputation.   
										</p>
										<p>
											A fellow student Jonathan Mason commented that at the company he works for it is recommended not to use services that make use of the Privacy Shield agreement.  	
											It is interesting that companies are looking past the legal agreements and making decisions for themselves regarding data protection. The Facebook example goes to show how trade deals can undercut local regulations.  
										</p>
										<p>										
											Thinking particularly cynically I wonder if companies that did not want to follow the stricter Data Protection rules of one country might intentionally exploit such trade agreements by moving aboard data processing abroad purely to circumnavigate such regulation.  
										</p>
											I think that the decision taken by Jonathan's company is a good one and a good example of the 'law enforcement' vs 'ethical perspective' debate that Nawaz Khan raised being answered ethically.   
										</p>
										<p>
											To Antonios Kalaitzakis's discussion of EasyJet's data breach, I contributed how the use of vulnerability alongside the penetration testing he proposed could feed into their improved cybersecurity analysis procedure.  
										</p>
										<p>
											To Anrich Potgieter's post regarding the Information Technology Acceptable Use policy enforced at his company, I commented on a procedure for secure password storage. 
											I commented that password storage is not defined by GDPR however the secure storage of such is of paramount importance as negligence here could lead to data leaks and other breaches. Anrich Potgieter considered the available options and agreed that master passwords can be best stored on paper.  
										</p>
										<p>
											In Man Sze Wong's initial post, she discussed that "countries or cities outside EU should promote some regulations which is similar to the GDPR". I agreed with this statement and offered that such organizations could optionally use the ISO 27001. </p>
